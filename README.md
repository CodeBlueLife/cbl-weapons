# cbl-weapons

This resource applies configurable damage multipliers to melee weapons using a centralized global configuration.
It ensures consistent combat balancing across the server by dynamically syncing weapon damage values and overriding GTA’s default melee behavior.

Easily adjust individual weapons like fists, bats, tools, and novelty items to match your server’s gameplay style without touching multiple scripts.
